# **DL Natural Language Processing**
# **Suitable Product Types Recommendation**

This program is designed for use in an e-commerce marketplace, helping sellers efficiently categorize their products. By analyzing the product description, the program suggests the most suitable product type. It offers four distinct product recommendations, namely Household, Books, Clothing & Accessories, and Electronics.

The process involves creating a Deep Learning (Artificial Neural Network) Natural Language Processing model based on product data. This model predicts the appropriate product type based on the description provided by the seller. The insights generated by the model will serve as a valuable reference for sellers to determine the best product type for their listing.

The model creation and evaluation are performed in the file model_creation_evaluation.ipynb. To optimize performance, it is recommended to run this model on Google Colab with Runtime Type T4 GPU, especially if GPU is not enabled on your local machine. The model is then applied to new data (inference) in the file model_inference.ipynb.


## **Introduction**

The **manual process** of selecting a product type for the marketplace led to issues, such as sellers choosing the wrong category. For example, if a guitar is mistakenly categorized as an "electronic device," it would be hard to sell, as it wouldn’t be visible to buyers in the "musical instruments" category. This **reduces visibility and delays sales**. Sellers facing long sales cycles may leave negative reviews, deterring potential sellers and impacting the platform’s ability to attract new customers and revenue.

To solve this, the marketplace should offer **product type recommendations** to help sellers choose the right category, **improving their experience and sales outcomes**.


## **Data Overview**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of two features. The first feature menjelaskan tentang deskripsi unik dari suatu produk yang berbeda dengan produk lainnya walau dengan tipe yang sama. The second feature menjelaskan tentang tipe produk tersebut. The second feature would be used for the target variable in prediction. It includes Household, Books, Clothing & Accessories, and Electronics.

Here’s a summary of the columns in the dataset:

|   Key Name   |      Description       |  Data Types |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| type         | Product's type         | Categorical |
| descriptions | Product's Descriptions | Categorical |

## **DL NLP Layers Employed:**

- Natural Language Processing
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Bidirectional
- Softmax Activation Function
- Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) Optimizer
- categorical_crossentropy Loss Function
- Accuracy Metric


## **Conclusion**

Although the model is overfitted, with a noticeable gap between accuracy and validation accuracy, both values exceed 9.3. Similarly, the training and test accuracy also show a discrepancy, yet both remain above 9.3. This indicates that, on average, the model makes 9 correct predictions out of 10. Despite the overfitting, this level of accuracy suggests that the model can effectively assist sellers in selecting the appropriate product type for their listings. However, the model's output is intended as supplementary guidance for sellers, not the sole basis for choosing a product type. As a result, the 10% error margin is considered acceptable and unlikely to have a significant impact.
